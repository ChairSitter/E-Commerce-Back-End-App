- This application will all the user to manipulate an e-commerce database in a secure manner. 
- This project aided my understanding of interacting with a database and coding routes for the various features a user needs to interact with a database in a practical manner.
- I learned distinctions among various routes and concepts about the use of foreign tags to link database tables together in a strategic manner.

To use this application, database name, username, and password credentials must be entered into a .env file on the user's computer. A database called ecommerce_db must be initialized in PostgreSQL. The command "npm install" must be run to set up the required dependencies. The command "node seeds/index" must be run to seed the database, then the command "node server" will start the server on port 3001 and run the application. The app can be run using insomnia to access all available server routes.
